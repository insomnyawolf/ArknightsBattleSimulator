If the feature you wanted isn't listed in either of the two category, feel free to open an issue about it.

## What doesn't work for now

If something isn't listed here and it doesn't work, contact via discord. [Link](https://discord.gg/xy5vFEHCWf)

### Leveling up operators or skills
- Change this via `config\charConfig.json` for now. (Until I make a UI for easy edit later on)

### Any base/profile/gacha/resource/store related stuffs
- This isn't your main option to play arknights with. Go do them on actual server.
- Might or might not add them later on

### Contengency Contract
- Broken due to new update. Wait for fix
